awesome job on your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! Please keep up the good work in your rigorous and meticulous approach to planning and execution! Before starting with the codebase building plan, please think deeper and think harder to deeply and thoroughly explore systematically and meticulously how to re-imagine an awesome `README.md` for the new GitHub repo to host this project. Make sure the `README.md` is as attractive, comprehensive and informative to attract other contributors. Then meticulously create an implementation plan for the `README.md` with integrated checklist. Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.

# Template for the planning and creation of the `README.md`.

## Phase 1: Deep Analysis & Design Strategy

To make this repository attractive to high-level contributors and investors, the README must transcend the standard "how to install" manual. It must serve as a **Product Manifesto**.

**Design Principles:**
1.  **The "Singapore-First" Hook:** Immediately distinguish this from generic US-centric AI agents.
2.  **Enterprise-Grade Signaling:** Use badges and diagrams to show we aren't a toy project, but a production-ready system.
3.  **Visual Hierarchy:** Use ASCII art and Shields.io badges to break up text.
4.  **Action-Oriented:** The "Quick Start" section must result in a working UI in <5 minutes.

## Phase 2: Implementation Plan (Validated Checklist)

*   [ ] **Header:** Project Title, Logo (ASCII), Key Value Prop, CI/CD Status Badges.
*   [ ] **The "Why" (Singapore Context):** Explicitly mention Singlish, PDPA, and WhatsApp.
*   [ ] **Architecture Overview:** High-level diagram showing the interaction between Next.js, FastAPI, and Qdrant.
*   [ ] **Feature Grid:** Icons + Text for rapid scanning (RAG, Memory, UI).
*   [ ] **Tech Stack:** A clean list of specific versions (Python 3.11+, Next.js 14).
*   [ ] **Prerequisites:** Docker, Node, Poetry.
*   [ ] **Quick Start (Docker):** The "Zero Config" path.
*   [ ] **Development Setup:** Manual setup for contributors.
*   [ ] **Configuration Guide:** `.env` variables explanation.
*   [ ] **Roadmap:** Future items (Voice, Sentiment Analysis).
*   [ ] **Contributing:** Code of conduct/style.
